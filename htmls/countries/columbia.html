            Colombia's updated NDC is more ambitious than its predecessor,
            setting an absolute emissions limit of 169Mt CO2e by 2030,
            equivalent to a 51% reduction compared to the BAU scenario. 
            The country aims to develop a carbon budget by 2023 and peak 
            emissions between 2027-2030. While Colombia is targeting renewable
            electrification, including wind, solar, and electric vehicles, it 
            lacks explicit targets for reducing fossil fuel usage and has not
            set a coal-phase out date. Colombia's 2050 carbon neutrality target
            is in place, but concrete mitigation measures and sectoral targets
            through 2050 are still needed.

                <h2>Energy Transition Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    Colombia's approach to energy transition is anchored in harnessing 
                    its unique geographic and climatic advantages. For example, the 
                    Guajira Wind Power Project exemplifies the country's commitment to 
                    expanding wind energy, leveraging the Guajira Peninsula's consistent 
                    winds. Similarly, Colombia is tapping into its solar potential through 
                    initiatives like the Cesar Solar Park, aiming to become one of the largest 
                    solar installations in the country. The government is also focusing on 
                    increasing the capacity of existing hydropower plants while exploring the 
                    potential for geothermal energy in volcanic regions. Efforts to promote 
                    the use of biofuels, particularly in transport, and the implementation of 
                    smart grid technologies in urban areas, further underline Colombia's 
                    multifaceted approach to transitioning towards a renewable energy future.

            South Korea's climate policy has shifted under the new government,
            prioritizing nuclear power over renewables. The 10th Basic Electricity
            Plan aims for a greater reliance on nuclear energy by 2030 and 2036,
            while maintaining similar targets for coal and LNG. This shift
            somewhat contradicts earlier commitments to renewable energy.
            The country's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
            sets an ambitious target of reducing emissions by 40% below 2018
            levels by 2030. However, this target is critiqued as "Highly
            insufficient" in meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature
            limit. The Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth,
            aiming for carbon-neutrality by 2050, underscores the government's
            ongoing efforts towards environmental commitments.

                <h2>Energy Transition Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    South Korea's energy transition strategies are centered around reducing its 
                    reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy, and moving towards renewable 
                    sources. A key example is the ambitious Sinan Solar Energy Project, 
                    poised to be the world’s largest floating solar farm. This project 
                    reflects South Korea's focus on innovative solar energy solutions, given 
                    its limited land availability. Additionally, the country is investing in 
                    offshore wind farms, with projects like the Southwest Offshore Wind Project, 
                    aiming to capitalize on its coastal geography. The government is also promoting 
                    the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source, with plans to 
                    establish a robust hydrogen economy. Efforts to improve energy efficiency 
                    in buildings and industries are also a significant part of South Korea's 
                    strategy to transition to a more sustainable energy system.

                <h2>Transportation and Infastructure Modernization</h2>
                <p>
                    In transportation and infrastructure, South Korea is making strides 
                    in electrifying its transportation sector. The city of Seoul, for 
                    example, has committed to replacing all public buses with zero-emission 
                    vehicles by 2030. The national government is supporting this transition 
                    through subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) and the expansion of charging 
                    infrastructure. South Korea is also focusing on the development of hydrogen 
                    fuel cell vehicles, with companies like Hyundai leading in this area. 
                    Furthermore, the country is modernizing its urban infrastructure to be 
                    more pedestrian-friendly and is expanding its public transportation networks 
                    to reduce reliance on personal vehicles.

                <h2>Industrial and Agricultural Reforms</h2>
                <p>
                    In the industrial sector, South Korea is promoting green 
                    technology and cleaner manufacturing processes. The Eco-Innovation 
                    Program, for instance, supports industries in adopting energy-efficient
                    technologies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In agriculture, 
                    South Korea is advancing sustainable farming practices and investing 
                    in technology to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production. 
                    The Smart Farm Innovation Valley initiative aims to develop high-tech, 
                    sustainable agricultural methods that can serve as a model for eco-friendly 
                    farming practices. These reforms are essential for reducing emissions from 
                    two of the most carbon-intensive sectors in South Korea.

                <h2>Policy Frameworks and International Collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    South Korea's policy frameworks are integral to its climate strategy. 
                    The Green New Deal, announced in 2020, lays out a comprehensive plan for 
                    achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with significant investments in green 
                    technologies and jobs. Internationally, South Korea is active in various 
                    climate change initiatives and partnerships, such as the P4G (Partnering 
                    for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030) network. Collaboration with global 
                    entities like the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) helps 
                    South Korea in accessing expertise and resources for its renewable energy 
                    projects. These policy and collaborative efforts underscore South Korea's 
                    commitment to a sustainable future and its role in the global fight against 
                    climate change.

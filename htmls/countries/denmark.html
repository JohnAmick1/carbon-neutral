            Denmark is striving to become one of the most climate-friendly countries,
            with a new climate law targeting a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
            by 2030 from 1990 levels and net zero emissions by 2050. This target surpasses
            the EU's goal of a 55% reduction over the same period. A comprehensive strategy
            with enhanced carbon pricing, backed by fiscal incentives across sectors, is proposed.
            Denmark is also considering "Feebates" to address high emissions in agriculture,
            particularly from farmed animals. This system would impose fees on high-emission
            products and rebates on low-emission products, encouraging sustainable
            farming practices.

                <h2>Energy Transition Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    Denmark's energy transition strategies are at the forefront 
                    of its efforts to become carbon neutral. A standout example is 
                    the country's world-leading wind energy sector, highlighted by 
                    the Horns Rev offshore wind farms. Denmark also pioneers in integrating 
                    renewable energy into the national grid, with a significant focus on solar 
                    energy and biomass. The Danish island of Sams√∏, known as the world's 
                    first renewable energy island, symbolizes Denmark's commitment to 
                    community-driven sustainable energy projects. Moreover, Denmark is 
                    exploring innovative energy solutions like green hydrogen production 
                    and energy storage systems to enhance the reliability of renewable 
                    sources.

                <h2>Transportation and Infastructure Modernization</h2>
                <p>
                    In transportation, Denmark is actively promoting the 
                    use of electric vehicles (EVs) and has set ambitious 
                    targets for phasing out fossil fuel-powered cars. 
                    The expansion of EV charging infrastructure across 
                    the country supports this transition. Denmark's capital, Copenhagen, 
                    is renowned for its bicycle-friendly infrastructure and is investing 
                    in cycling as a sustainable mode of urban transportation. The city also 
                    boasts a comprehensive and efficient public transportation network, 
                    including metro, buses, and trains, all increasingly powered by renewable
                    energy.

                <h2>Industrial and Agricultural Reforms</h2>
                <p>
                    Industrial reforms in Denmark focus on increasing energy efficiency 
                    and reducing carbon emissions. The Danish government supports industries in 
                    implementing cleaner technologies and sustainable practices. In agriculture, 
                    Denmark is a leader in organic farming and is investing in technologies to 
                    reduce the environmental impact of farming activities, including initiatives 
                    to lower methane emissions from livestock. The country also focuses on 
                    sustainable fishing practices, reflecting its commitment to environmental 
                    stewardship across all sectors.

                <h2>Policy Frameworks and International Collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    Denmark's policy frameworks are integral to its environmental strategy. 
                    The Danish Climate Law, which aims for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas 
                    emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, sets a legally binding framework 
                    for climate action. Internationally, Denmark is an active participant in 
                    climate change discussions, contributing to global initiatives such as the 
                    Paris Agreement. The country also engages in numerous international 
                    collaborations, sharing its expertise in wind energy and sustainable city 
                    planning. Through these efforts, Denmark not only advances its own green 
                    transition but also contributes to global climate change mitigation and 
                    sustainable development goals.
